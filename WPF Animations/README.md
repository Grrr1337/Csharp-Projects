  - Demonstrates `ColorAnimation` for seamless background color transitions.

### 2. Dynamic Code-Behind Animations
- **Interactive Button Animations:**
  - Responds to mouse enter and leave events to trigger dynamic animations in code-behind.
  - Utilizes `DoubleAnimation` and `ColorAnimation` to create engaging button interactions.

### 3. Window Dragging with Animation
- **Draggable Window Enhancement:**
  - Implements interactive window dragging with a smooth animation effect.
  - Enhances user experience by providing an animated window movement.

### 4. Stylish Button Customization
- **Button Styling Techniques:**
  - Showcases styling approaches for buttons in both XAML and code-behind.
  - Utilizes templates to customize button appearance while maintaining animation responsiveness.

### 5. Event-Driven Animation Handling
- **Mouse Events for Animation Control:**
  - Efficiently handles mouse events (e.g., `MouseEnter` and `MouseLeave`) to control animations.
  - Achieves a cohesive user experience through event-driven animation management.
