  - Sets headers for menu items dynamically.

### 2. Canvas Drawing
- **Rectangle Drawing:**
  - Draws rectangles with different colors on the canvas.
  - Demonstrates positioning and sizing of rectangles.

- **Ellipse Drawing:**
  - Illustrates drawing ellipses with varying sizes and colors.
  - Centers ellipses on the canvas.

- **Checkerboard Pattern:**
  - Creates a checkerboard pattern with alternating colors.

### 3. Line Drawing and Styling
- **Single Line Drawing:**
  - Draws a single line with specified coordinates and style.

- **Multiple Random Lines:**
  - Generates multiple random lines on the canvas.
  - Utilizes random colors and positions.

- **Bezier Curve:**
  - Implements a Bezier curve using the `Path` element.

### 4. Text Rendering
- **TextBlock Usage:**
  - Renders text using the TextBlock element.
  - Applies font styling and rotation.

- **Label and TextBlock Interaction:**
  - Allows users to drag and move a TextBlock on the canvas.
  - Demonstrates basic user interaction with text elements.

### 5. UI Event Handling
- **Keyboard Events:**
  - Captures keyboard events to enable specific actions.
  - Responds to key presses to trigger different functionalities.

### 6. Randomization
- **Random Shape Generation:**
  - Generates a random number of ellipses with varied colors and sizes.
  - Enhances the visual appeal with dynamic shapes.

### 7. Code Organization
- **Modular Code Structure:**
  - Organizes code into methods and event handlers for clarity.
  - Encapsulates drawing logic for each menu option.
