# WPF Window and Code-Behind Interaction

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application using XAML for defining the UI and C# for the code-behind. The application consists of a main window.

## XAML (MainWindow.xaml)

```xml
<Window x:Class="MyWpfApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MyWpfApp"
        mc:Ignorable="d"
        Title="Title for my Wpf App" Height="300" Width="300">
</Window>
```

# WPF Window and Code-Behind Interaction

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application using XAML for defining the UI and C# for the code-behind. The application consists of a main window.

## XAML (MainWindow.xaml)

```xml
<Window x:Class="MyWpfApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MyWpfApp"
        mc:Ignorable="d"
        Title="Title for my Wpf App" Height="300" Width="300">
</Window>
```
In the XAML file (MainWindow.xaml), the Window element defines the visual layout of the main window. It specifies various attributes such as the window's title, height, and width. The xmlns attributes define XML namespaces, allowing the use of XAML elements and attributes specific to WPF.


In the XAML file (**MainWindow.xaml**), the **Window** element defines the visual layout of the main window. It specifies various attributes such as the window's title, height, and width. The **xmlns** attributes define XML namespaces, allowing the use of XAML elements and attributes specific to WPF.

### Default XML Namespaces in XAML:
<details>

<summary>Click to expand: Default XML Namespaces in XAML</summary>

- **xmlns**: This is the default namespace for WPF elements. It declares the XML namespace that is used for WPF-specific elements without a prefix.

- **xmlns:x**: This namespace is typically reserved for XAML-specific attributes. The x:Class attribute, for example, indicates the class associated with the XAML file.

- **xmlns:d**: This namespace is used for design-time attributes. It allows you to specify attributes that are relevant only during design-time, providing a separation of concerns between design and runtime.

- **xmlns:mc**: This namespace is used for markup compatibility attributes. The **mc:Ignorable** attribute, in this case, specifies that the 'd' namespace is ignorable, allowing for cleaner XAML in design tools.

- **xmlns:local**: This namespace is specific to the current project. It allows you to reference classes and resources defined in your project within the XAML.

## Code-Behind (MainWindow.xaml.cs)

```csharp
namespace MyWpfApp
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml
    /// </summary>
    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    }
}
```
In the code-behind file (**MainWindow.xaml.cs**), a partial class named MainWindow is defined. It extends the **Window** class, indicating that it corresponds to the XAML-defined main window. The **InitializeComponent()** method is called in the constructor, linking the XAML and code-behind. This method initializes the components defined in the XAML file.

## Explanation
The XAML file describes the visual structure and appearance of the main window, while the code-behind file provides the logic and behavior associated with the window. Together, they create a cohesive WPF application where the user interface is defined declaratively in XAML, and the corresponding logic is implemented in the code-behind file.
