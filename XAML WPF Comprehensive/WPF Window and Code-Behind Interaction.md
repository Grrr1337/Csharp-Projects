# WPF Window and Code-Behind Interaction

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application using XAML for defining the UI and C# for the code-behind. The application consists of a main window.

## XAML (MainWindow.xaml)

```xml
<Window x:Class="MyWpfApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MyWpfApp"
        mc:Ignorable="d"
        Title="Title for my Wpf App" Height="300" Width="300">
</Window>
```

In the XAML file (**MainWindow.xaml**), the **Window** element defines the visual layout of the main window. It specifies various attributes such as the window's title, height, and width. The **xmlns** attributes define XML namespaces, allowing the use of XAML elements and attributes specific to WPF.

## Code-Behind (MainWindow.xaml.cs)

```csharp
namespace MyWpfApp
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml
    /// </summary>
    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    }
}
```
In the code-behind file (**MainWindow.xaml.cs**), a partial class named MainWindow is defined. It extends the **Window** class, indicating that it corresponds to the XAML-defined main window. The **InitializeComponent()** method is called in the constructor, linking the XAML and code-behind. This method initializes the components defined in the XAML file.

## Explanation
The XAML file describes the visual structure and appearance of the main window, while the code-behind file provides the logic and behavior associated with the window. Together, they create a cohesive WPF application where the user interface is defined declaratively in XAML, and the corresponding logic is implemented in the code-behind file.
